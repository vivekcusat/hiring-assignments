# Recruitment assignment for Site Reliability Engineer

This task is intended for candidates applying for an SRE position at the Visma e-conomic operations team. This assignment is built around some of the technologies used in our production environment.

We're super happy that you're considering to join us here at e-conomic, the challenge below should hope to bring a small view into the life of an SRE here, and serve as a entrypoint for a good discussion at the technical interview.

## Introduction

e-conomic runs a broad palette of services to provide the functionality our application serves our customers, a big part of this functionality is provided by a layer of microservices.
These microservices are hosted in Kubernetes and have different requirements in terms of availability and resilience, both from the requests they serve but also the data that some of them hold.
To verify how well a given candidate fit our needs, the test is built with the intention for you to show of your skills in some of the technologies we use on a daily basis.  
Should you feel like expanding above and beyond the scope of the test, feel free to do so. We will enjoy discussing your reasoning for doing so.

## The Challenge

Develop a microservice that:

* Takes HTTP GET requests with a random ID (/1, /529852, etc.), requests a document from the microservice we have provided in the `dummy-pdf-or-png` subdirectory of this repository, and then returns the document with correct mime-type.
* Provides an endpoint for health monitoring.
* Has a Kubernetes Manifest.
* Has Readiness and LivenessChecks.
* Has a Dockerfile.
* Has tests, so regressions can be identified.
* Failing Safe is a priority.
* The service should log relevant information

Overall the service must be considered production-ready.

Stretch goal: Provide Prometheus metrics from the service.

## Delivery

Fork this repository into a public repository on your own Github profile, and deliver your solution there.
