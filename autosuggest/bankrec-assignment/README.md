# Assignment used for Data Scientist Position

This task is intended for candidates applying for a Data Science position at e-conomic. The assignment contains real data and directly reflects the actual challenges we face at e-conomic when we are trying to apply machine learning to the field of automating accounting processes.

The assignment is split into two parts. In the first part you are expected to write code, build predictive models, measure the quality of these models and document your results. In the second part you are not expected to implement a predictive model, but instead you are expected to devise and propose a theoretical solution to the problem.

## The problem
Companies often have a lot of expenses. Each payment of these expenses is in accounting terms called a financial transaction which should be entered into the financial books. But where? This is the job of the accountant to figure out. An expense for paint might go to the maintenance account, and an expense for a taxi ride might go to the account for travel expenses.

In e-conomic it is possible to import your bank statements and use these to create the financial transactions, so all you have to do is to import the bank statements, and decide on which account you want to book each expense ..and you’re done.

But what if we could make this process even smoother by learning how the expenses should be booked? Wouldn’t that be great? If we know that a company's books looks like this:

    “Cleaning service & Co”	        --> Maintenance account
    “Andersen’s cleaning service”   --> Maintenance account
    “McDonald's Nørrebro”           --> Employee catering account

We might just go ahead and help the company do future bookings of _“McDonald's Nørrebro”_, or maybe we can assist the company with new like _“Copenhagen Cleaning Company”_ if we build a clever model, or maybe we might even be able to help with _“Burger King Kastrup Airport”_ if we look at how other companies usually do their bookkeeping.

__A few things to notice:__

* The same text from the bank statements might lead to two different accounts. An example of this is that you might buy both food for your employees (which you might want to put on the _Employee catering account_) and chocolate (which you might want to put on the _Gifts and flowers account_) in the same shop.
* Each company have their own chart of accounts. However many companies have a chart of account that varies only a little from the e-conomic default chart of accounts.
* Two companies that have the same chart of accounts might not agree how certain expenses should be booked. An example of this might be sandwiches bought for a meeting with business partners. One company might always put this on the _Employee catering account_, another one might always put it on the _Meetings account_, and a third might even have a _Sandwiches for meetings with business partners account_.
* Each account has a number. There are no restrictions on these account numbers besides that an account number is unique within a company. So the _Travel expense account_ in one company might have the same number as the _Employee catering account_ in another company.

## Part 1 - Per company prediction

How can we help the accountant do the bookkeeping of the company’s expenses? To start out simple and to limit the amount of workload, we avoid the challenge of companies having different chart of accounts by making per company predictions, ie. train a model for each company and make each prediction based on only the company's own model.

In this part you are expected to write code, build predictive models, measure the quality of these models and document your results.

Your solution to this task you will be judged on criteria related to the product that you will be delivering when working at e-conomic, eg. among other things: coding style, approach to problem solving, guiding the research by data driven decisions, documentation of your results, choice of quality measure, etc.

Please note that this is not a classical text book example where a pretty solution is known to exist. You might not be satisfied with your results, and there might not even exist a solution that would be good enough to go into a real product. The goal of the exercise is not to arrive at a nice model, the goal is to show us what approach you take.

## Part 2 - Can we do better?

Alright, in Part 1 above you developed a predictive model to predict accounts based on each company’s own data. What if we wanted to utilize all the data we have across all 100.000 companies? Then we would also be able to help companies that has no or little data. But how should we even tackle the problem of constructing such a model? (We do not regard this as an easy question, and there is no single right solution.)

In this part you are _not_ expected to implement a predictive model, but instead you are expected to devise and propose a theoretical solution to the problem.

Your solution to this task you will be judged on criteria related to the value that you are bringing to the team, eg. creativity, knowledge within mathematical modeling, communicating your ideas, ability to discuss pros and cons of different solutions, etc.

## Description of data
The dataset consist of expenses from 100 random companies. For each company we provide all expenses that was booked in e-conomic.

Description of each column in the dataset:
- __CompanyId:__ The identifyer of the company to help you slice and dice the data in the right way.
- __BankEntryDate *(feature)*__: The date of the financial transaction.
- __BankEntryText *(feature)*__: The text following along with the financial transaction. This is typically machine generated, but in case of manual transactions they may be manually written by a human. _Please note that the text has been split into words before they have been hashed._
- __BankEntryAmount *(feature)*__: The amount of the financial transaction. Expenses are negative, earnings are positive.
- __AccountNumber *(target)*__: The account number. The uniquely identifies an account, and can therefore be used as the target variable / the class that we want to predict.
- __AccountName__: The name of the account.
- __AccountTypeName__: The type of the account.

Columns marked by _(feature)_ Can optionally be used as a feature in your predictive model. All of these features are typically what you see when you look at your bank statement. The _AccountNumber_ is your target variable. The _AccountName_ and the _AccountTypeName_ are properties of the account, and hence not of direct interest to the prediction problem, but if you can come up with creative ways of using it, then feel free to do so.

The rows are sorted first by _BankEntryDate_, then by _CompanyId_.

Due to privacy reasons the amounts has been bucketed and the texts has been obfuscated using the following function:

    data = query(limit = 100) # Pandas DataFrame

    def short_hash(word):
        try:
            int(word)
            typ = 'int'
        except:
            typ = 'str'
        bytes_ = word.encode() + secret_salt
        sha_word = hashlib.sha512(bytes_).hexdigest()
        return '{}:{}'.format(typ, sha_word[:7])

    def obfuscate_text(string_):
        return " ".join([short_hash(w) for w in string_.split()])

    def modify_row(row):
        # Translate AccountTypeName to english
        row['AccountTypeName'] = 'Profit and Loss' \
            if row['AccountTypeName'] == 'Drift' else 'Balance'
        # Obfuscate AccountName
        row['AccountName'] = short_hash(row['AccountName'])
        # Obfuscate BankEntryText
        row['BankEntryText'] = obfuscate_text(row['BankEntryText'])
        # Obfuscate CompanyId
        row['CompanyId'] = short_hash(row['CompanyId'])

        p_bar.update()
        return row

    data = data.apply(modify_row, axis=1)

    # Bin BankEntryAmount
    data['BankEntryAmount'] = pd.cut(
        data['BankEntryAmount'],
        bins=[float('-inf'), -10000, -1000, -100, -10, 0, 10, 100, 1000,
              10000, float('inf')],
        labels=['big negative', '> -10000', '> -1000', '> -100', '> -10',
                '< 10', '< 100', '< 1000', '< 10000', 'big positive']
    )

    data.to_csv(output_filename)

The data is a zipped `.csv` file called `bank_expenses_obfuscated.csv.zip`.

## Data example

Here's the top three rows from the data set:

|   | CompanyId   | BankEntryDate | BankEntryText           | BankEntryAmount | AccountName | AccountNumber | AccountTypeName |
|---|-------------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0 | int:a055470 | 2016-02-29    | str:6cd08e4 int:49fed34 | > -1000         | str:1e82557 | 9900          | Balance         |
| 1 | int:a055470 | 2016-02-29    | str:6cd08e4 int:49fed34 | > -1000         | str:9ce853c | 3115          | Profit and Loss |
| 2 | int:a055470 | 2016-02-29    | str:38248d2             | > -100          | str:a9f0788 | 2240          | Profit and Loss |

## Guidelines
We would like to remind you of a few important things:
- **Important:** This data it real. An acceptable model might not exist, so don't feel bad if your results are disappointing.
- Focus on the right stuff. Don't spend many hours on data wrangling and other stuff that does not show us your true skill-set. Instead, please make a few assumptions, and make sure to tell us about the assumptions you made.
- We do not judge you on the accuracy of your predictive model, but on your problem solving skills. So don't spend all your time tweeking parameters.
- If you feel that you want to know more about the usecase so the you can better derive the external requirements (like the maximum response time at prediction time, or the importance of model interpretability)? Then you can either make up your own requirements assumptions (remember to tell us about these), or ask us.
- Use what ever tech stack you feel comfortable using.

## Got stuck?
You can always email us and ask for advice or just ask question to ensure you correctly understood the task. This will not be seen as a sign of weakness, to the contrary it shows that fully understanding the problem is important to you.
